# Welcome

## Who are us?
Our team consists of two members - @tdrkDev and @rtx4d.
We are enthusiasts, that want M6 note to have future.

## Why MeizuSucks?
### Open-Source kernel
Open-Source kernel lets you to don't care about security problems. All security patches are merged to kernel and ROM.

Also in process of reverse-engineering stock kernel, I've figured out that **closed stock kernel have backdoors**.

### Good kernel drivers
Refactored code after reverse-engineering is working stable and very good. Stock kernel drivers are not perfectly optimized.

### Performance increase
Out [chat](https://t.me/msucks_chat) members did research and figured out that performance increases (in some tests/games) on MeizuSucks.

For example, **Call Of Duty Mobile** works very good on **Medium** graphical settings on MeizuSucks Q, but works not very good on **Low** graphical settings on MeizuSucks N and other N ROMs, maybe Flyme 6/7/8.
